  <p>What is metadata and what is it for?<br> 
    Metadata is simply data about data, a way to describe it. It is used to summarise information about data to make it easier to track and work with. 
One example of when metadata is used is in photography. The photographer can add metadata to its image; author, place taken, time taken,
lens used, if the flash went off etcetera. This makes it easy if you want to use an image and need to see who took it so that can can then ask the person for permission to use it. 
So the photo is the data, and the information about it that has been added, is the metadata.
